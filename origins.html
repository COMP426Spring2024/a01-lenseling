        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Wukong was born from a magical rock atop Mount Huagou. He had remarkable abilities from birth, like speech and the ability to walk, and his golden-eyed gaze caught the attention of the Jade Emperor. However, the emperor dismissed him as inconsequential. Wukong joined a group of monkeys and became their leader. His prowess led to him becoming a powerful forest demon, engaging in battles and acquiring legendary weapons. When summoned by the Kings of Hell, Wukong cleverly avoided reincarnation and erased his and his companions' names from the Book of Life and Death, prompting concern from Yan Wang, who sought the Jade Emperor's intervention.

      <div class="col"><h2>Trouble in Heaven</h2>
        <p>
          Upon hearing of the troublesome demon Sun Wukong, the Jade Emperor decided to invite him to live among the gods in Heaven, hoping to placate him with a sense of importance. However, upon arrival, Wukong was assigned the task of guarding the Jade Emperor's horses. He realized that he would never be considered an equal by the other gods due to his simian nature. Obsessed with attaining immortality to prove himself, Wukong rejected the Jade Emperor's guidance and declared himself the "Great Sage Equal to Heaven." When excluded from a party and mocked by the gods, Wukong's hurt pride led him to defy the emperor openly, resulting in a battle where Wukong emerged victorious, forcing the Jade Emperor to recognize his power and promote him to guard the Peaches of Immortality. Feeling slighted by this, Wukong defiantly devoured all the peaches, leading to his banishment from Heaven and his imprisonment beneath a mountain by Buddha's decree.

        <h2>Journey to the West</h2>
        <p>
          After enduring 500 years beneath the weight of the mountain, Wukong encounters the traveling monk Tang Sanzang. Initially resistant to the idea of servitude, Wukong eventually agrees to become the monk's disciple in exchange for his freedom. Guanyin, the goddess of mercy, gifts Tang a magical band to control Wukong, who joins Tang's journey alongside other demonic companions, including Zh≈´ BƒÅji√® (Piggy) and ShƒÅ W√πj√¨ng (Sandy). Throughout their travels to India, Wukong faithfully serves Tang and confronts demons, ultimately undergoing a transformation through noble deeds and adherence to Tang's teachings, achieving enlightenment and shedding his former negative traits.
