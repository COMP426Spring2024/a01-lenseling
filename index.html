      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        In "Journey to the West," the Monkey King is born from a special magic
        stone nurtured by both heaven and earth, possessing positive and
        negative energies respectively. The stone gives birth to a stone egg,
        from which emerges a stone monkey imbued with magical abilities. After
        joining a group of monkeys and becoming their king, he sets out on a
        quest for immortality. Eventually, he finds a Taoist master who teaches
        him advanced practices, including the Way of Immortality. Armed with a
        magical staff and attire gifted by Dragon Kings, he returns to his tribe
        and forms an alliance with other powerful beings. Despite facing death
        sentences and challenges from Hell, the Monkey King's prowess and
        cunning enable him to defy all odds and emerge victorious against
        heavenly forces and underworld rulers alike.
